; DESCRIPTION: XYZ Probing macro for FRONT LEFT CORNER with a 1/4" Endmill
; INSTRUCTIONS: start with the end mill 15mm ABOVE the xyz probe, about 15mm or less from the bottom left corner. Tested with Shapeoko xyz probe
;
; ;This Macro is to be used with an active low touch probe.
;It DOES Require adjustment for different endmill sizes.
;It DOES require adjustments for different probe sizes. Please see comments below.

; List of Variables
; ENDMILL_DIAMETER = 6.35	;in millimeters
; Endmill diameter 1/8"  = 3.175	;in millimeters
; PROBE_BLOCK_Z = 22.5	; Thickness of 3-axis probe in Z direction for Shapeoko XYZ PROBE (+1mm my block probe error)
; PROBE_BLOCK_Y = 7 	; Thickness of 3-axis probe in Y direction for Shapeoko XYZ PROBE
; PROBE_BLOCK_X = 7	; Thickness of 3-axis probe in X direction for Shapeoko XYZ PROBE
; G38.2 is used to probe for workpeice
