; DESCRIPTION: XYZ Probing macro for FRONT LEFT CORNER with a 1/4" Endmill
; INSTRUCTIONS: start with the end mill 15mm ABOVE the xyz probe, about 15mm or less from the bottom left corner. Tested with Shapeoko xyz probe
;
; 
; List of Variables
; ENDMILL_DIAMETER = 3.175	;in millimeters
; ENDMILL_DIAMETER = 1.5875	;in millimeters
; PROBE_BLOCK_Z = 22	; Thickness of 3-axis probe in Z direction for Shapeoko XYZ PROBE
; PROBE_BLOCK_Y = 7 	; Thickness of 3-axis probe in Y direction for Shapeoko XYZ PROBE
; PROBE_BLOCK_X = 7	; Thickness of 3-axis probe in X direction for Shapeoko XYZ PROBE
; G38.2 is used to probe for workpeice

G38.2 P1 Z-100 F45								; Probe Z downwards
G4 P0.1 			
G10 P1 L20  Z22									; Set Current Z  of WCS #1 as [Probe Block Z] thickness (22mm)

; Probe X
G0 Z3 											; lift Z 3mm
G0 X-25											; Move left 25mm
G0 Z-10											; Move down 10mm, should be 7mm below probe surface
